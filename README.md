# Iris-Multiclass-Classification
This machine learning program is a Python project: the program uses gradient descent and a regression algorithm to identify types of Iris flowers. The logistic classifier algorithm utilizes OneHotEncoding to enumerate input values (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, class) and uses an Activation method to optimize the estimation. This program displays in the console the number of correct and incorrect results (class of iris) as well as the proportion value of accuracy. This project uses Python and its libraries/frameworks, such as Numpy, OneHotEncoding, SkLearn, MatPlotLib, Gradient Descent, and Backpropagation.
